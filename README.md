## Project Overview

This project utilizes smart building data to:
- Analyze energy usage patterns.
- Identify inefficiencies.
- Recommend actionable insights to optimize performance.

Smart buildings leverage IoT devices to collect real-time data on various parameters such as temperature, humidity, energy usage, and occupancy. This analysis serves as a step toward sustainable building management.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains:

- **Energy Usage Metrics**: Hourly/daily energy consumption data.
- **Environmental Data**: Temperature, humidity, CO2 levels.
- **Occupancy Information**: Patterns of usage and foot traffic.

> Note: Detailed information about the dataset structure and source can be found in the `data/` folder.

## Features

### Key Features of the Analysis:
- **Energy Efficiency Analysis**: Identifying high-consumption patterns and proposing energy-saving strategies.
- **Occupancy Analysis**: Understanding how building space is utilized.
- **Visualization Dashboards**: Interactive plots and dashboards for decision-making.
- **Predictive Models**: Using machine learning to forecast energy consumption trends.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Collection and Cleaning**:
   - Loaded the dataset and handled missing/null values.
   - Normalized and standardized the data for better model performance.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized energy trends, occupancy patterns, and environmental metrics.
   - Identified correlations and patterns in the data.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Extracted meaningful features from raw data for modeling purposes.

4. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - Built regression models to forecast energy usage.
   - Evaluated models using RMSE, MAE, and R2 metrics.

5. **Visualization**:
   - Created interactive plots using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
   - Presented dashboards for stakeholders.
